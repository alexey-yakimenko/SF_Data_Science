### What case are we solving?
We need to write a program that guesses the number in the minimum number of attempts.

**Competition conditions**
- The computer guesses an integer from 1 to 100, and we need to guess it. By "guess" I mean "write a program that guesses a number".
- The algorithm takes into account information about whether the random number is greater or less than what we need.

**Quality metric**
The results are evaluated by the average number of attempts at 1000 repetitions.

**What we practice**
Learning to write good Python code
